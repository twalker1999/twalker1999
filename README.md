## Hi there 👋
I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. You can reach me at my email address  📫 taylor_walker@berkeley.edu. I am fascinated🤔 by symbiotic relationships involving coral (e.g., viruses and Symbiodiniaceae). I love horror movies, exploring new food spots around town, and going to the beach!
